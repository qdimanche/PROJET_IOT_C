# TCP Server Setup Guide

## 1. Making the Server Executable
Before running the TCP server, you need to grant execution permissions to the file. Open a terminal and run the following command:

chmod +x /Users/quentindimanche/Projects/junia/mastere/projet-iot/CBOR_TCP_server_macos.dmg

## 2. Running the TCP Server Locally
Once the file is executable, you can start the server by running:


./Users/quentindimanche/Projects/junia/mastere/projet-iot/CBOR_TCP_server_macos.dmg

## 3. Setting Up TCP Tunnel with Pinggy
To expose your local TCP server using Pinggy, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Pinggy Dashboard** on their website.
2. Navigate to the **TCP Tunnel** section.
3. Set the **Share Port** value to `4567`.
4. Select the appropriate OS (`Mac ZSH`).
5. Copy the generated SSH command and execute it in your terminal.

### Example SSH Command:
ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:4567 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ServerAliveInterval=30 YJCIaMpNMbs+tcp@free.pinggy.io

## 4. Verifying the Connection
After executing the SSH command, your server should be accessible via the provided Pinggy TCP address. You can test the connection using:

If the connection is successful, your TCP server is now publicly accessible!
